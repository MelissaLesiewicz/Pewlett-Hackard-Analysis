# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:
Pewlett Hackard has over 300,000 employees, many of whom are nearing retirement age. I created a database of all employees and their employment history at Pewlett Hackard. The goal of the current project is to identify all employees nearing retirement, the positions that will be vacant, and to identify those employees in the promotion pipeline for the upcoming vacancies. 

## Results:
*    Almost one-third of Pewlett Hackard employees are at retirement age.
*    Less than 2,000 employees are in the promotion pipeline to fill the vacancies that will be created.
*    Almost 30,000 Senior Engineers are close to retirement.
*    Out of the 9 departments, 2 managers are at retirement age.

## Summary:
There are 90,398 employees at retirement age, which in nealy one-third of all employees at Pewlett Hackard. If even half of these employees retire without someone in line to step into their role, PH will be sorely understaffed. There are 1,549 employees currently eligible for a mentorship program which would leave many roles vacant. It would be helpful to open up the mentorship program to younger employees. I'd like to know how many employees born before 1975 and their current titles to see who could be eligible for the mentorship program. It would be very helpful to know which departments are losing which roles as it is more cost effective and efficient to mentor someone within the same department for a promotion that it is to cross train someone to a new department.
